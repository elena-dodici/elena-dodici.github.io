  Hello, I'm Jiaqi, a Computer Engineering graduate student at Polytechnic University of Turin, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. 
  
  I usually use Java and Javascript to develop and test in projects.While machine learning can be challenging, I enjoy the process of building and tuning models, almost like caring for a baby.
  
  In the end, welcome to my site! I'm thrilled that you're here :)!

           We implement SonarCloud and designed hundreds of unit & integration tests to realize higher coverage ratio and eliminate code smells.
          
           Several functions(action, artifacts) in a GitHub and Docker implementation are used to enable efficient code deployment.        
          
           Skilled in both **Scrum, Waterfall** development process.

          We use the idea from GAN to disentangle domain-specific features successfully from images.

          During project, we reproduced Dom2Vec model to tackle . After that, we imported CLIP model to assist with feature disentanglement tasks, and fine-tuned it to improve its ability to perform downstream tasks.
          
          We are so pround of that a great improvement on accuracy is achived!

          Employed various technologies, such as Regularization and normalization, to preprocess and analyze raw data.
          
          Trained various models, including SVM, GMM, and Logistic Regression, with the most accurate model achieving 85% accuracy.

          I constructed SQL databases for riddles and users with a suitable schema design. Data validation is used to ensure a ributness of database. I also built a RESTful APIs that served data to front-end(React) based on diverse requests.
