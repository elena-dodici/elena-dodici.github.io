  Hello, I'm Jiaqi, a Computer Engineering graduate student at Polytechnic University of Turin, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. 
  
  I usually use Java and Javascript to develop and test in projects. For machine learning ,it is a challenge for me, but I enjoy the time when I build model and tune it, it's like caring for a baby. No pain, No gain.
  
  In the end, welcome to my site! I'm thrilled that you're here :)!

           We developed a web application from front-end to a back-end and optimized each role's interactions with the app, more test cases were used and more complexed cases were considered. I obtained new technology skills through this project such as SonarCloud, artifacts in github, Docker, etc.

          By utilizing the concept of GANs, we disentangled domain-specific and category-specific features from train domain and applied the resulting model to various other domains to address the task of domain adaptation.

          During the project, we tackled domain shift issue by reproducing Dom2Vec model and leveraged CLIP model to assist with feature disentanglement tasks. Through fine-tuned CLIP, we were able to significantly improve the accuracy (>10%) of the model !

          It is my first machine learning project, where I learned the theoretical foundations of classic models and how to implement them from scratch.
          In addition to modeling, also gained valuable experience in data preprocessing and model evaluation during this project.

          It is my first personal project. I have designed the whole application from A to Z successfully. This project gave me a more specific understanding of web development, and provided me with clearer ideas for designing more complex applications in the future.
